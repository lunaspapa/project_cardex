# Project Cardex

Project Cardex combines collecting Pokémon cards with the fun of a Pokédex. I've always enjoyed browsing through the Pokédex in the many games I've played throughout my life.
And I've always enjoyed collecting Pokémon cards as well. I wanted to create something that combined both of those things together where a user can click on a Pokémon and see
every card printed for that Pokémon.
